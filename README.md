** Beta **

See the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for the latest changes

I am often asked, "What are you favorite VS Code extensions for Angular?". I decided it was time to share them via an extension pack. 

Introducing my [Angular Essentials extension pack for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnpapa.angular-essentials). By installing this extension pack you get a set of great extensions that are helpful with Angular development. You can check out the initial list below.

> As web tools evolve, the usefulness of extensions come and go. I reserve the right to update the extension pack's contents up to my own discretion.

Here is the list of extensions the pack includes:

[Angular v4 Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnpapa.Angular2) - Angular snippets that follow the official style guide, for TypeScript, templates, and RxJS.

[Angular Language Service](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Angular.ng-template) - This extension provides a rich editing experience for Angular templates, both inline and external templates. This extension is brought to you by members of the Angular team. It is fantastic at helping write solid code in the html templates. 

[Editor Config](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig) - EditorConfig for VS Code. Great for maintaining consistent editor settings.

[tslint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eg2.tslint) - Integrates the tslint linter for the TypeScript language into VS Code. Extremely helpful at detecting and helping fix TypeScript issues.

[Chrome Debugger](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome) - VS Code debugger for Chrome.

[Bracket Pair Colorizer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer) - This extension allows matching brackets to be identified with colors. This is super helpful when you have nested functions and objects.

[JSON to TypeScript](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MariusAlchimavicius.json-to-ts) - Convert JSON object to typescript interfaces. I don't use this a lot, but it can be helpful. I tend to use the VS Code multi cursor to refactor JSON, but this is easier for this infrequent task.

[Path Intellisense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=christian-kohler.path-intellisense) - Visual Studio Code plugin that autocompletes filenames. Hopefully, VS Code will bake this in at some point. Until then, this is a keeper.

[Angular Emmet](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jakethashi.vscode-angular2-emmet) - Support zen-coding syntax for Angular 2 typescript files. Again, hopefully, VS Code will bake this in at some point. Until then, this is a keeper.

[Angular Inline](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=natewallace.angular2-inline) - Visual Studio Code language extension for javascript/typescript files that use Angular2.
